# QuestProject
Code for an AR text-translating device which is powered by a Raspberry Pi

(The final program is overlay.py)

#Overview

For my Quest Project, which is a yearlong 8th grade passion project for my school, I decided to build, from scratch, an augmented reality (AR) device that translates text seen by the camera.

# Hardware
I used a Raspberry Pi Model 5 connected to a 7" ROADOM touchscreen. I hooked up the Raspberry Pi to a Camera Module 3, and I housed the display inside of a plastic black case.

# Software
I downloaded Visual Studio Code and coded my software in Python. I used a host of libraries, some of them downloaded onto my virtual environment. Note: I changed the system path so it would recognize libraries installed on either the Raspberry Pi or the system, which is why some of the libraries in my final program (overlay.py) are not contained in my virtual environment.
